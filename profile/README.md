# The Modal Cube Revisited: Semantics without Worlds

This set of repositories contains some tools **under construction** to support
the recently proposed procedures based on non-deterministic matrices
(Nmatrices) for modal logics. The details of the method can be found in the
paper (The Modal Cube Revisited: Semantics without Worlds)[https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12824],
by Renato Leme, Carlos Olarte, Elaine Pimentel and Marcelo E. Coniglio.
